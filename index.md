# Logbook

When I was an undergraduate student; I had a professor that always propose nice
projects and request a "logbook" at the end of the task. Logbooks are an
unstructured text which we explain operations, and approaches taken by us to
finish the work; in a nutshell, it is an analogy with navigation of a ship.
After many years, I still like this concept and continuously use it in my life.

So, here is my logbook about my journey in Operating Systems (OS) research. But
why bother? Simply because I am passionate about this area, for me, OS is one
of the human masterpieces achievements. As a result, I dedicated many hours of
my life trying to understand this field, and I believe that is a good idea to
write about it.
